;  CKIT.EXE (FRUA v1.2) resident frame 10d7: the long multiply helper Turbo C's code
;  calls for 32-bit `*`.  EXE 0x005c3e..0x005c52, 20 bytes, 10d7:2ace..10d7:2ae2.
;
;  Borland's interface, and a Borland body, though not CL.LIB's: the same 20
;  bytes are in TC 2.0's and 2.01's own TC.EXE, TCC.EXE and CPP.EXE (TC-2-01
;  TCC.EXE at 0x26a6e).  dx:ax * cx:bx, the low 32 bits of the
;  product returned in dx:ax.  The same for signed and unsigned operands.  It
;  keeps the low multiplicand in bp (saved) rather than testing for zero high
;  words, so it always does three MULs.  cx is not preserved; bx is.
;
;  Ported from Dark Queen of Krynn's reviewed source (dqk-disassembly,
;  v11/src/asm/lxmul.asm): the same bytes, 2Bh lower in the frame than DQK's
;  (see sysint.asm).
;
;  v1.0's image has the same 20 bytes at the same offset, so v10/ uses this
;  source unchanged.
;
;  Assembled by TASM 3.1, /ml, single pass.  No segment fixups, and the MZ
;  relocation table has no entry in this range.
