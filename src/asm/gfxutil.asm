;  CKIT.EXE (FRUA v1.2) resident frame 10d7, after lowlevel.asm: five small
;  far routines for the screen and resource code -- a masked pattern column, the huge
;  pointer add, an indexed video register write, a run-length row drawer
;  with its near row skipper, and a two-buffer byte swap.  EXE
;  0x003ea1..0x003fa5, 260 bytes, 10d7:0d31..10d7:0e35.  lowlevel.asm ends
;  at 0x3ea1; dissolve.asm starts at 0x3fa5.
;
;  Ported from Dark Queen of Krynn's reviewed source (dqk-disassembly,
;  v11/src/asm/gfxutil.asm): DQK's instructions at the same frame offsets;
;  only the DGROUP offsets of vidmouse.c's variables differ (externs the
;  build resolves: draw_seg d60d, text_bytes d746, base_offset d75a,
;  extent_text d75d, screen_addr d75f).
;
;  Hand assembly in the house style of lowlevel.asm (C far entry, arguments
;  from [bp+6], DS = SS = DGROUP on entry, DGROUP read through SS once DS
;  points elsewhere).  Why these routines are one file is a choice, not a
;  measurement: between 10d7:0009 and 10d7:1f37 the frame has no far call
;  within the frame, pad byte or change of style to mark a source-file
;  boundary.
;  They are grouped as the small drawing helpers ahead of the full-screen
;  dissolves; the only tie the bytes prove is runs_draw's near calls to
;  runs_skip.
;
;  Assembled by TASM 3.1, /ml, single pass.  No segment fixups: the range
;  holds no MZ relocation and the object makes none.  The DGROUP words are
;  externs the build resolves to their offsets.

;  pattern[phase], phase counting on modulo 16 row by row.  The scan-line step
;  is lowlevel.asm's row_advance written inline (text_bytes, plus base_offset
;  at a bank's end).  DQK's vidmouse.c calls it for the left and right edge
;  words of a pattern fill; nothing in CKIT.EXE calls it.
