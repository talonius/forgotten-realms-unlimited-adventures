;  CKIT.EXE (FRUA v1.2) resident frame 10d7: the structure copy helper Turbo C's code
;  calls for struct assignment.  EXE 0x005cae..0x005cd9, 43 bytes, 10d7:2b3e..10d7:2b69.
;
;  Borland's interface: far call with cx = the byte count and two far pointers
;  on the stack, the source at [bp+6] (loaded as ds:si) and the destination at
;  [bp+0Ah] (es:di); the helper pops both (retf 8).  ax, cx, dx and es are not
;  preserved.
;
;  Not Borland's body: Borland's copies forward by words; this one copies by
;  bytes and picks a direction.  It copies BACKWARD when the source's segment
;  is above the destination's, or, failing that, when the source's offset is
;  above the destination's; otherwise forward.  Run under emulation, that is
;  the reverse of the direction an overlapping copy needs: with the source
;  above, the backward copy overwrites source bytes before it reads them, and
;  with the source below, the forward copy does the same, so an overlapping
;  copy is corrupted either way; for blocks that do not overlap the direction
;  makes no difference.  The forward path relies on the direction
;  flag being clear on entry; both paths clear it on the way out.
;
;  Ported from Dark Queen of Krynn's reviewed source (dqk-disassembly,
;  v11/src/asm/scopy.asm): the same bytes, 2Bh lower in the frame than DQK's
;  (see sysint.asm).
;
;  v1.0's image has the same 43 bytes at the same offset, so v10/ uses this
;  source unchanged.
;
;  Assembled by TASM 3.1, /ml, single pass.  No segment fixups, and the MZ
;  relocation table has no entry in this range.
