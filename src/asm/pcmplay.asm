;  CKIT.EXE (FRUA v1.2) resident frame 10d7: the PC-speaker sample player.
;  EXE
;  0x00420f..0x0050a7, 3736 bytes, 10d7:109f..10d7:1f37: a 32-word jump
;  table, then one far routine whose body is 32 unrolled cases.
;  dissolve.asm ends at 0x420f; the routine glyphfx.c calls at 10d7:1f37
;  starts at 0x50a7.
;
;  Ported from Dark Queen of Krynn's reviewed source (dqk-disassembly,
;  v11/src/asm/pcmplay.asm): DQK's instructions, byte for byte, at the
;  same frame offsets; digisnd.c calls it, as in DQK.
;
;  Why this is a file of its own is a choice, not a measurement (see
;  gfxutil.asm's header): nothing else in the frame touches the table, the
;  speaker or the timer, and the table sits right before its routine as the
;  dissolves' tables do before theirs.
;
;  How it plays, as far as the bytes show it.  Samples are 4 bits, two to a
;  byte, low nibble first.  PIT channel 2 runs in mode 2 (rate generator)
;  with the caller's divisor -- only its low byte reaches the PIT, as the
;  channel is programmed LSB-only -- so its count falls from the divisor to
;  1 and reloads once per sample period.  Port 61h has the timer 2 gate on
;  throughout; its bit 1, the speaker data enable, is what the cases
;  switch: dl holds port 61h with it clear (SPEAKER_OFF), dh with it set
;  (SPEAKER_ON).  Each nibble value 0..15 has a case that drives the
;  speaker for one period: 0 keeps it off, 15 keeps it on, and 1..14 switch
;  it on and off inside the period, for a share that by the cases' shape
;  (below) grows with the value; the pulse widths and gaps are timed by
;  instruction counts (NOPs, dead `mov al,dh/ah` fillers, JMP_NEXT).  A case polls the latched count with
;  PIT_READ: above 28h it is early in the period, at or below 28h late, and
;  a count above 28h after a late reading means the counter reloaded --
;  the period is over and the case dispatches the next nibble.  The cycle
;  counts of the paths are not analysed here.
;
;  Each value has two copies of its case: lo<n> plays a low nibble and then
;  indexes the same byte's high nibble (FETCH_HIGH, table entries 16..31),
;  hi<n> plays a high nibble and then loads the next byte and indexes its
;  low nibble (FETCH_LOW, entries 0..15).  The two copies differ only in
;  that fetch, so both are one DUTY<n> macro below.  The cases also come in
;  complementary pairs, the same code with the speaker's two states
;  exchanged: 15 is 0 reversed and 9..14 are 7..2 reversed, so DUTY0..DUTY8
;  take the state to pulse to and the state to rest in as arguments.  1 and
;  8 have no partner.
;
;  Interrupts are off for the whole call (cli at entry, sti at the end).
;  bx indexes the jump table, bh = 0.  jcxz cannot reach play_again from
;  most cases, so each such case has a `jmp play_again` just before it
;  (<case>_again).  cx counts bytes off as they are loaded, and the
;  low-nibble case tests it after its first speaker write, so a pass ends
;  there on the last byte: that byte's nibbles are not played out.
;
;  v1.0's image has the same 3736 bytes at the same offset, so v10/ uses this
;  source unchanged.
;
;  Assembled by TASM 3.1, /ml, single pass: a forward jmp is EB xx 90, as
;  shipped, and JMP_NEXT is such a jmp to the next instruction.  No segment
;  fixups: the range holds no MZ relocation and the object makes none (the
;  jump table's words are offsets within the segment).
