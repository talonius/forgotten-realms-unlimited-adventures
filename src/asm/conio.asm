;  CKIT.EXE (FRUA v1.2) resident frame 10d7: console character I/O
;  through DOS -- read a key with and without echo, two tests on standard
;  input's state, write a character (with '\n' as CR LF), DOS's direct
;  console call, and write a DGROUP string.  EXE 0x0055b9..0x005626, 109
;  bytes, 10d7:2449..10d7:24b6.  lzcodec.asm ends at 0x55b9; strings.asm
;  starts at 0x5626.
;
;  Ported from Dark Queen of Krynn's reviewed sources (dqk-disassembly,
;  v11/src/asm/conio.asm and cputs.asm), which FRUA's bytes put in ONE
;  file.  DQK's con_puts reaches con_putc_dl (10d7:2483, the second entry
;  of con_putc) by a relocated far call, 9A 83 24 D7 00, so DQK keeps it in
;  a file of its own (cputs.asm).  FRUA's con_puts makes the same call as
;  0E E8 D1 FF, `push cs; call near`, and the range has no MZ relocation:
;  that is what TASM 3.1 in its default SMART mode assembles for a far
;  call to a far label in its own segment (measured by the DQK port, see
;  its conio.asm), so here the caller and the callee are one source.  The
;  call is 4 bytes, not 5, so con_puts is 22 bytes and everything after it
;  in the frame sits one byte lower than DQK's.  Every other byte is DQK's.
;  The bytes would read the same under NOSMART with an explicit near call,
;  but the frame was assembled with the default everywhere else.
;
;  Where the file ends, 24b6, is a choice: str_cat after it keeps a bp
;  frame, a different house style, and is a string routine, not console
;  output.  Where it starts, 2449, is the first byte after lzcodec.asm's
;  last retf.  stdin_not_tty shares stdin_idle's `return 1` (a jump from
;  10d7:2473 to 2462), so those two are one file in DQK as well.
;
;  Register style: no bp frame; the one argument read through bx = sp,
;  ss:[bx+4], the first word past the far return address.  The result is in
;  ax.  bx and dx are not preserved; con_puts saves si.
;
;  v1.0's image has the same 109 bytes at the same offset, so v10/ uses this
;  source unchanged.
;
;  Assembled by TASM 3.1, /ml, single pass.  No segment fixups, and the MZ
;  relocation table has no entry in this range.
